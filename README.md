Motivated from resolving the compression problem forDNA data and from this aforementioned challenge, we introduce a novel encoding algorithm that is lossless, reference-free,resolves this challenge, and is applicable not only to DNA data to any textual data. By implementation, the algorithm showsbetter compression results indeed. As it has been a tradition to name the encoding algorithms by names, and to exploit this factto honoring two great professors, Last author and Pramod Srivastava (Professor at Department of Immunology, University ofConnecticut School of Medicine) who highly and exceptionally advised the first author in his academic career, kindly refer tothis algorithm by Okaily-Srivastava-Tbakhi (OST).
